Title: Big Data Size Estimation -- What's the magnitude of the problem?

Summary: Before designing a technical solution to any problem, it is first 
and foremost important to assess the magnitude of the problem. In this 
presentation for students of the RU Big Data course, I discuss the 1998
WWW Conference paper of Sergey Brin and Larry Page that introduces Google. 
(an absolute classic, cited more than 17,000 times!) I will identify 
the design choices that made Google the world's most influential search 
engine. These design choices include a forerunner of the Google File 
System (called BigFiles, where chunks are called barrels), a forerunner 
of MapReduce (by means of explicit Sorters), as well as PageRank, anchor 
text extraction, and a classical inverted index (that may all be 
computed by MapReduce). The design choices that are less well-known, 
however, are based on how Brin & Page estimated the magnitude of the 
problem. I will re-do those estimations for today's Google, and 
re-formulate some of the computations using the MapReduce framework.
